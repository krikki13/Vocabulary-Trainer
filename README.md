# Vocabulary-Trainer

Let's English is not your primary language, but you are still fluent in it. But then you pick up a book in English and there are loads of words that you have never heard of. 
To remember these wordsy+ you should write them down and practice them.

This is why you need the Vocabulary Trainer. You add words to it and it can then generate quizes. To keep things interesting, the app is more likely to pick words that you
have problem remembering. Also once you add enough words for the app to pick from, it will try to give you such incorrect answers that resemble the correct one, to make it harder to guess.

Main problem in current state:
Adding new words is tedius. I could not find a dictionary API that would give me some free look ups per month, so you have to use a different app to translate
and them copy them to the app. That is slow.
